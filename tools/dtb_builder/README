DTBOs for the SPI based Waveshare 3.5inch RPI LCD (C) do not work any longer with SDL / Pygame on Debian Bookworm.
The reason is the lacking Direct Rendering Manager support (DRM) which SDL relies on with KMSDRM to control the display.

General support is available with the Piscreen DTBO:
https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-6.1.y/arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/piscreen-overlay.dts

However the DTBO's settings do not allow for screen rotation in KMS/DRM mode.

As a result a remix of these 3 DTBOs has been created with the GPIO includes being resolved to allow for easy compilation with dtc:
https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-6.1.y/arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/piscreen-overlay.dts
https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-6.1.y/arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/piscreen2r-overlay.dts
https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-6.1.y/arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/watterott-display-overlay.dts

The resulting piscreen.dts is available in this folder and can be compiled with:
dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o piscreen.dtbo piscreen.dts

Then you need to copy it to the overlay folder:
sudo cp piscreen.dtbo /boot/overlays/

Run the piscreen_builder.sh script to compile the piscreen.dts and copy it to the tpotmobile/settings folder.
If you need adjustments after installation of the Raspberry Pi T-Pot copy the newly compiled piscreen.dtbo to the overlays folder.

The tpotmobile/settings folder will contain a config.txt example, however the installer will handle the adjustments.

Should the rotate / rotation settings not fit your setup you can adjust the piscreen.dts with 0, 90, 180 or 270. Then compile and reinstall it.
